## 🛠️ Tools & Supplies

- Rear paddock stand or secure method to lift the rear wheel off the ground  
- **Slacker digital suspension scale** (or metric tape measure + helper)  
- H5 Allen key (chain guard cover bolts & gas canister bolts)  
- H10 Allen key (upper and lower shock bolts)  
- 32 mm socket (rear axle nut)  
- Shock spanner wrench  
- Socket and wrench set  
- Red tacky grease (optional — to hold washers during install)  
- Torque wrench  
- Loctite (blue)  
- Chain adjustment tools

## 📏 Step 1 — Measure Stock Uncompressed Ride Height

1. Place the bike on level ground with the rear wheel unweighted.  
2. Using a **Slacker** or tape measure, record the distance from the **rear axle center** to a fixed point on the tail section.  
3. **Note this measurement** — this is your baseline uncompressed ride height.

---

## 🔄 Step 2 — Remove Chain Guard Cover

1. Locate the chain guard cover on the left side of the bike above the chain.  
2. Remove the **5 bolts** securing it using an **H5 Allen key**.  
3. Set the cover and bolts aside.

---

## 🔄 Step 3 — Remove the Stock Shock

1. Support the bike securely so the rear wheel is off the ground and the suspension is unloaded.  
2. Remove the **upper and lower shock bolts** using an **H10 Allen key**.  
3. Carefully remove the shock from the frame.

## ⚠️ Critical Note — Top Shock Washers

The aftermarket lowering shock **includes two thin washers** that are **critical** to install at the **top of the shock**.

- Without these washers, the **upper bushing will compress into the upper shock mount**, causing damage.  
- Use a small amount of **tacky red grease** to hold the washers in place during installation.  
- **Warning:** This step is tedious — take your time to ensure proper alignment before inserting the upper mounting bolt.

---

## 🔄 Step 4 — Install the Lowering Shock

1. Position the new lowering shock in place.  
2. Install the **top bolt first**, ensuring the critical washers are in place.  
3. Install the bottom bolt.  
4. Torque the **upper and lower shock bolts to 60–70 Nm** and apply **blue Loctite**.

---

## 🔋 Step 5 — Install the Gas Canister

1. Locate the **right-side passenger peg bracket**.  
2. Position the gas canister mount so the hose is routed cleanly without kinks.  
3. Use an **H5 Allen key** to install the **two mounting bolts** into the bracket.  
4. Tighten snugly — use **blue Loctite** if desired to prevent loosening from vibration.

---

## 📏 Step 6 — Measure Lowered Uncompressed Ride Height

1. With the bike still unweighted, measure again from the **rear axle center** to the same fixed point on the tail section.  
2. Subtract this number from your original measurement to get the **total drop** in the rear.

---

## 🔧 Step 7 — Adjust Front Fork Height to Match Rear Drop

Lowering the rear changes the bike’s geometry. To maintain handling balance, you should raise the front forks in the triple clamps by the **same amount the rear was lowered**.

### Measuring Stock Height
1. Place the bike on a paddock stand or otherwise secure it upright.  
2. Using a set of **digital calipers**, measure from the **top of the fork tube** (not including the cap) to the **underside of the top triple clamp**.  
3. On our test unit, the stock measurement was **12 mm** — yours may vary slightly.

### Calculating the New Measurement
- Take your **rear drop measurement** from Step 6.  
- Add this value to your **stock fork height measurement** to get the **new target measurement**.  
- **Example:** If stock is **12 mm** and your rear drop is **20 mm**, your new fork height should be **32 mm**.

### Adjusting the Forks
1. Loosen the **upper and lower pinch bolts** on one fork leg (do **not** loosen both legs at once to avoid the front end dropping unexpectedly).  
2. Gently slide the fork tube upward in the triple clamp until the calipers read your **new target measurement**.  
3. Tighten the **upper pinch bolts first**, then the lower bolts. Torque to manufacturer specs from the service manual.  
4. Repeat on the other fork leg, ensuring both sides are perfectly matched.

**⚠️ Tip:** Work slowly and keep the bike secure to prevent it tipping forward when loosening the pinch bolts.

## 📏 Step 8 — Set Rider Sag (25–35 mm)

**Sag** is the amount the bike compresses under the rider’s weight.

1. With the rider in full gear, measure from the rear axle to the fixed tail point while sitting on the bike.  
2. Subtract this number from the uncompressed ride height.  
3. Adjust preload until sag is between **25–35 mm**.

### Adjusting Preload on This Shock
- Remove the shock from the bike.  
- Loosen the **set screw** on the preload ring.  
- Use a shock spanner to rotate the upper ring to increase or decrease preload.  
- Tighten the set screw after adjustment.  
- Reinstall the shock and recheck sag.

## ⛓️ Step 9 — Check and Adjust Chain Slack

Lowering the bike changes the swingarm angle, which can affect chain tension.

1. With the bike on level ground, measure chain slack at the midpoint between the front and rear sprockets.  
2. The nominal chain play for the 675SS is **30–40 mm**.  
3. After lowering, yours may measure tighter — for example, **20 mm**, which is too tight.  
4. Loosen the **32 mm axle nut** and adjust the chain to within the recommended range before riding.  
5. Re-tighten the axle nut to **90 Nm**.

---

## 🏁 Final Checks

- Verify that all bolts are torqued to spec.  
- Double-check washer placement at the top of the shock.  
- Ensure no interference with swingarm or canister hose movement.  
- Confirm chain slack is correct.  
- Test ride carefully to confirm handling and ride height.

---

## ⚠️ Warnings

- Failure to install the top washers will **damage the upper bushing**.  
- Always match front fork drop to the rear drop to maintain safe handling.  
- Recheck torque and chain slack after the first ride.
