## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Cool Engine & Flat Surface**  
   Park the bike on a level surface and let the engine fully cool down.

2. **Remove Radiator Cap**  
   Helps air flow out while draining. Never do this when hot!

3. **Drain Coolant**  
   - Locate the **drain bolt on the water pump housing** (bottom-side, copper washer).
   - Loosen and allow coolant to drain into catch pan.

4. **Bleed Air from Thermostats**  
   - Locate the **bleed bolts** on top of the thermostat housing (on each cylinder).
   - Slightly loosen until coolant starts flowing steadily, then re-tighten.

5. **Optional Flush**  
   - Pour distilled water into the radiator.
   - Run briefly, then drain again.
   - Repeat until clean if desired.

6. **Refill Coolant**  
   - Tighten the drain bolt.
   - Slowly fill radiator with coolant.
   - Watch for overflow from bleed bolts, then tighten them.
   - Fill to just below the radiator neck.

7. **Run & Top Off**  
   - Start the bike and let it idle.
   - As the fan cycles on, top off radiator as needed.
   - Replace radiator cap and fill overflow tank to the proper level.

8. **Recheck Over Next Few Rides**  
   - Coolant may drop slightly as air escapes.
   - Check overflow reservoir and top off as needed.
