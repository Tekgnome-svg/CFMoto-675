## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Warm Up Engine
Let the engine idle for 2–3 minutes. Shut off and let it cool slightly.

### 2. Remove Lower Fairing Cover & Front Header Access Panel
- Remove four 5 mm Allen bolts from the lower plate to expose the oil pan and drain plug.  
- Remove the 5.5 mm Allen bolts from the front header panel to access the oil filter.

### 3. Drain the Oil
- Place drain pan under the engine.  
- Loosen the 17 mm drain bolt with a socket wrench and remove by hand carefully.  
- Let the oil drain completely; opening the filler cap speeds draining.  
- Inspect for metal shavings (normal in small amounts for new bikes).

### 4. Replace Crush Washer & Drain Plug
- Install a new M12/14x20x1.5 mm crush washer on the drain plug.  
- Thread plug by hand, then snug with a wrench. Torque: **20–25 Nm (14–18 ft-lb).**

### 5. Remove Old Oil Filter
- Place a shop towel under the filter to catch drips.  
- Use a filter wrench or adapter to loosen and remove the filter by hand.

### 6. Install New Oil Filter
- Apply a thin coat of fresh oil to the gasket.  
- Thread filter by hand until snug, then tighten ¾ turn more.  
- Do not overtighten.

### 7. Reinstall Covers
- Reattach front header panel and lower fairing plate with 5 mm Allen bolts.

### 8. Add New Oil
- Use a funnel to pour in **3 quarts (3.1 L)** of 10W-40 synthetic oil.  
- Start the engine, idle 1–2 minutes, then shut off.  
- Check the oil level in the sight glass with the bike upright.  
- Slowly add oil from the 4th quart if necessary until between MIN and MAX.

### 9. Final Checks
- Inspect for leaks around drain plug and filter.  
- Dispose of used oil and filter responsibly.  
- Record mileage in your maintenance log.

✅ **You're done! Your CFMoto 675SS is ready to ride.**
