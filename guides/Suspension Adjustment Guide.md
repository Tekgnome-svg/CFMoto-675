# üèçÔ∏è CFMoto 675SS Suspension Adjustment Guide

This guide covers **front and rear shock absorber adjustmenst** for the CFMoto 675SS.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DANGER:** Shock absorbers contain high-pressure nitrogen. Improper operation may result in explosion. Do not put in fire, open the hole, or disassemble improperly. Contact a certified engineer for any adjustments beyond basic guidance.

## Front Shock Absorbers

The **front RH shock absorber** is disassembled and installed the same way as the **front LH shock absorber**.

### Rebound Damping Adjustment

- Rebound damping end is inscribed with `TEN`.
- **Effect:** Controls reaction speed during rebound.
- **Lower gear (S direction):** slower rebound.
- **Higher gear (H direction):** faster rebound.
- **Initial gear:** 10  
- **Total gears:** 20 ¬± 2  

**Adjustment Procedure:**

1. Use a flat-head screwdriver to rotate the gear:
   - Counterclockwise (S) to reduce rebound.
   - Clockwise (H) to increase rebound.
2. Record rotation counts to restore factory settings if needed.
3. Reverse rotation according to recorded counts or rotate:
   - Clockwise (H) to minimum.
   - Counter-clockwise (S) to gear 10.
4. **Do not adjust yourself** beyond this. Contact an engineer if necessary.

**Shock absorber oil:** OILNO-00M01  
**Oil capacity:** 450 mL ¬± 2 mL

### Compression Damping Adjustment

- Compression damping end is inscribed with `COMP`.
- **Effect:** Controls reaction speed during compression.
- **Lower gear (S direction):** slower compression.  
- **Higher gear (H direction):** faster compression.  
- **Initial gear:** 10  
- **Total gears:** 20 ¬± 2  

**Adjustment Procedure:**

1. Rotate with flat-head screwdriver:
   - Counterclockwise (S) to reduce compression.
   - Clockwise (H) to increase compression.
2. Turn clockwise until it stops, then back to first gear (counter-clockwise).  
3. Reverse rotation according to recorded counts to restore factory settings.  
4. **Do not adjust yourself. Contact an engineer.**

## Rear Shock Absorber

### Pre-Work

- Remove the rear fork panel (see Chapter 06 for details).

### Removal

1. Remove bolts (Torque: 60‚Äì70 N¬∑m).  
2. Remove rear shock absorber.

**Shock absorber oil:** OILNO-00M01  
**Oil capacity:** 450 mL ¬± 2 mL  

### Inspection

- Check for visible damage or cracks. Replace if necessary.  
- Clean dust and mud.  
- Press the seat several times to ensure normal compression and rebound.

---

### Rear Shock Preload Adjustment

- Adjust spring preload to suit rider weight and riding conditions.
- **Initial gear:** 4  
- **Total gears:** 10  

**Procedure:**

1. Use the shock absorber adjusting wrench to turn the spring seat:
   - Direction `a`: reduce preload  
   - Direction `b`: increase preload
2. Factory settings are optimal for most situations.

### Rebound & Compression Damping (Rear)

- **Rebound adjustment:** controls speed during rebound  
  - Lower gear ‚Üí slower  
  - Higher gear ‚Üí faster  
- **Compression adjustment:** controls speed during compression  
  - Lower gear ‚Üí slower  
  - Higher gear ‚Üí faster  

**Restore to factory settings:** Reverse rotation according to recorded counts, or rotate to minimum/gear 10 as reference.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact an engineer for any adjustment outside basic settings.

**Notes:**

- Front and rear adjustments follow the same principles.  
- Always handle with care and wear protective equipment.  
- Follow all torque specifications to avoid damage or unsafe conditions.
