## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Removal Instructions

1. **Let the Bike Cool Completely**  
   Never work on a hot exhaust — risk of burns.

2. **Remove the Rear Heat Shield**  
   - Use a **5mm Allen key** to remove the bolts securing the heat shield over the exhaust outlet.  
   - Set aside safely.

3. **Spray Bolts with Penetrating Oil (Optional)**  
   - If the exhaust has been in place for a while, lightly spray the header bolts to help loosen them.

4. **Remove the Rear Mounting Bolt**  
   - Use a **12mm socket** to remove the bolt securing the rear of the exhaust system to the chassis.

5. **Remove Header Bolts**  
   - Use a **12mm socket with extension** to remove the **six header bolts** (two per cylinder).  
   - These go directly into the cylinder head — no studs.

6. **Carefully Remove the Exhaust**  
   - Support the exhaust as you pull it **rearward and downward**.  
   - It's a single piece and moderately heavy. Use both hands to prevent scratching the frame or engine.

## 🧪 Header Gasket Notes

- The system uses **crush-style exhaust gaskets** between the headers and cylinder head.  
- You **can reuse the original gaskets** **if they’re undamaged and seal well**.  
- If in doubt, replace them with OEM or compatible gaskets during reinstallation.

## 🏁 Pro Tip

> “Loosen the rear bolt before touching the header bolts — it helps support the weight and eases removal.”

## 🔧 Reinstallation Tips

- If reusing the OEM exhaust, inspect the crush gaskets closely.
- Torque bolts **evenly** across all three cylinders during reinstallation.
- Suggested torque for header bolts: **~20 Nm (14–15 ft-lb)**  
- Reinstall the heat shield last for easier alignment.
